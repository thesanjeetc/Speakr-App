# Speakr-App

Speakr is a web app which allows you to write in air, using your mobile as a pen. It utilises the onboard IMU to record movements, before translating them to an image, and then running handwriting recognition on them to determine the written text. This text is then played out loud, via text-to-speech.

Speakr demonstrates a novel form of communication, which can be applied to many different scenarios. For example, it can be used as a natural form of communication for those who are unable to talk, although this requires further research. It can be used as part of third-party mobile games for greater interactivity or for quick note taking. With this setup, gestures such as arrows and shapes can be recognised with custom ML models, for more intuitive controls with smart home devices or perhaps signalling an emergency. The possibilities presented by gesture to text/speech translation are truly endless.
